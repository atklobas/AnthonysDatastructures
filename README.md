# AnthonysDatastructures
implementing data structures is a good way to understand them


It should be noted that I'm writing theses simply to get a better feel for their inner workings
and such I'm trying to minimize repeated/copy pasted code. 
some of the classes have (almost) no non-academic purpose, and many classes are designed to access their
superclasses fields,most of these are package protected, If you really wanted to create a BalancedBinarySearchTree 
you'd want to combine all 3 of its parents into a single class.
